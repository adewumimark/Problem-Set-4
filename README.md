# Problem-Set-4
For each API, write a script (or Jupyter Notebook) to retrieve information using that API and select part of that to save/print/graph/display in a useful/interesting manner.

I used the Global Biodiversity Information Facility API located at https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/openapi/ to form a query that inputs a species' scientific name and outputs 5 relevant pieces of literature from the database. I thought this was an interesting and relevant way to practice API usage.
